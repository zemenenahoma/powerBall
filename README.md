# powerBall

Python Programming Project
Powerball
General Instructions: 
•	Your assignment should be a Python program
•	Your assignment will use what we have learned so far (e.g. conditional statements, array, array built-in functions, and loop). 
•	You may also utilize the Internet as an extra source to help with your code. For example, you might need some useful built-in array functions, e.g. shuffle () if you use arrays to do this assignment. However, there are many correct ways to write a program.  All roads lead to Rome. 
•	No excuse for late work.  
•	All identical work will result in zero points for all parties involved. 
•	Your instructor can help with the explanation of this assignment but won’t help with debugging your code. 
Instructions in detail: 
Part I: Assignment file structure (15 points) 
•	Create a folder called powerball (1 point) 
•	Inside the powerball folder, you need to create a subfolder according what we have learned so far. (2 point).
•	 The project must be implemented in OOP (12 point)
•	Use comment in the relevant areas – Mandatory requirement.

  
Part II:  The READ ME header information: (6 points) 
•	The READ ME file must have a document type so that a user’s browser knows what version is used. (1 point) 
•	The READ ME file  must include all data , and metadata: 
o	Title – PowerBall Project (1 point)   
o	Metadata: description , keywords, and author. Author name is your full name. (4 points)   
Part III: How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?
•	The Powerball game in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results. 
•	The Powerball game includes two parts. 
o	Part, one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, …, 17,18,19, 20). 
o	Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10). 
•	When your program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers, your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers. 
Here is one of the examples when I run my code.  
 

Every time you run your program/page, your  would display the winning numbers, and your lucky numbers, and the result respectively. For example, after I rerun my program several times, I got this one: 
 

Sometimes if I am lucky, I can get this one: 
 
Grading: Today’s Powerball Winning Numbers (27 points) 
•	The first five numbers (purple) are random numbers drawn from 20 numbers (11 points) – hard code results in zero points. 
•	The first five numbers (purple) should be in ascending order (11 points) - hard code results in zero points.
•	The Powerball number (gold) is a random number drawn from 10 numbers from 1 to 10. (5 points) - hard code results in zero points.
Grading: Your lucky numbers: (32 points) 
•	The first five numbers (purple) are random numbers drawn from 20 numbers (12 points) – hard code results in zero points. 
•	The first five numbers (purple) should be in ascending order (15 points)  - hard code results in zero points.
•	The Powerball number (gold) is a random number drawn from 10 numbers from 1 to 10 inclusively. (5 points) - hard code results in zero points.

Part IV: Use if or switch conditional statements to display the result based on your lucky numbers and winning numbers. (20 points) 
•	Correct White Balls and the Powerball: Jackpot $324,000,000
•	5 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $1,000,000
•	4 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $10,000
•	4 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $100
•	3 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $100
•	3 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $7
•	2 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $7
•	1 Correct White Ball and the Powerball: $4
•	No White Balls, Just the Powerball: $4
•	All Other situations – display “try again!” 

How to deliever?
