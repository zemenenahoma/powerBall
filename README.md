Description
Anyone playing the lottery can be carried away with fantasies about unspeakable riches and ways of spending it unspeakably fast. From a data point of view, looking into the numbers can be a fun project to practice some of the tools you have under your belt, and can actually lead to interesting experiments.

Can you predict lottery numbers? Assuming the drawings are indeed random the answer is no. Can you expect certain numbers to pop up in the future? Well, not really.

Given a large enough sample size — according to the law of large numbers — all you can expect is that the average value of the numbers drawn is going to be very close to the expected value.

Looking into what happened in the past could be still fun — if you want to choose your next winning combination, well, go ahead, build a hypothesis and find your favourites.
To do this project I have faced a lot of problems. For example I have faced to change the list of elements in to string listed style number, and the other challange was making an inheritance between two classes .


Python Programming Project
Powerball
General Instructions: 
•	Your assignment should be a Python program
•	Your assignment will use what we have learned so far (e.g. conditional statements, array, array built-in functions, and loop). 
•	You may also utilize the Internet as an extra source to help with your code. For example, you might need some useful built-in array functions, e.g. shuffle () if you use arrays to do this assignment. However, there are many correct ways to write a program.  All roads lead to Rome. 
•	No excuse for late work.  
•	All identical work will result in zero points for all parties involved. 
•	Your instructor can help with the explanation of this assignment but won’t help with debugging your code. 
Instructions in detail: 
Part I: Assignment file structure (15 points) 
•	Create a folder called powerball (1 point) 
•	Inside the powerball folder, you need to create a subfolder according what we have learned so far. (2 point).
•	 The project must be implemented in OOP (12 point)
•	Use comment in the relevant areas – Mandatory requirement.

  
Part II:  The READ ME header information: (6 points) 
•	The READ ME file must have a document type so that a user’s browser knows what version is used. (1 point) 
•	The READ ME file  must include all data , and metadata: 
o	Title – PowerBall Project (1 point)   
o	Metadata: description , keywords, and author. Author name is your full name. (4 points)   
Part III: How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?
•	The Powerball game in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results. 
•	The Powerball game includes two parts. 
o	Part, one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, …, 17,18,19, 20). 
o	Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10). 
•	When your program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers, your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers. 
Here is one of the examples when I run my code.  
 

Every time you run your program/page, your  would display the winning numbers, and your lucky numbers, and the result respectively. For example, after I rerun my program several times, I got this one: 
 

Sometimes if I am lucky, I can get this one: 
 
Grading: Today’s Powerball Winning Numbers (27 points) 
•	The first five numbers (purple) are random numbers drawn from 20 numbers (11 points) – hard code results in zero points. 
•	The first five numbers (purple) should be in ascending order (11 points) - hard code results in zero points.
•	The Powerball number (gold) is a random number drawn from 10 numbers from 1 to 10. (5 points) - hard code results in zero points.
Grading: Your lucky numbers: (32 points) 
•	The first five numbers (purple) are random numbers drawn from 20 numbers (12 points) – hard code results in zero points. 
•	The first five numbers (purple) should be in ascending order (15 points)  - hard code results in zero points.
•	The Powerball number (gold) is a random number drawn from 10 numbers from 1 to 10 inclusively. (5 points) - hard code results in zero points.

Part IV: Use if or switch conditional statements to display the result based on your lucky numbers and winning numbers. (20 points) 
•	Correct White Balls and the Powerball: Jackpot $324,000,000
•	5 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $1,000,000
•	4 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $10,000
•	4 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $100
•	3 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $100
•	3 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $7
•	2 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $7
•	1 Correct White Ball and the Powerball: $4
•	No White Balls, Just the Powerball: $4
•	All Other situations – display “try again!” 

How to deliever? 
•	Deploy to Git
•	Upload your code file to Engage before the deadline 
You will get zero points 
•	If you miss the deadline for the assignment. No excuse! 
•	If you copy the other person’s work.
•	If you let other(s) copy your work.
